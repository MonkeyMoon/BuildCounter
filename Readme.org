* BuildCounter

Simple script that takes and updates major.minor.patch + commit_hash content of a Unity asset.

** Create the BuildVersion.asset file
- A default file is shared in =UnityFiles/BuildVersion.asset= as an example.
- Add =UnityFiles/BuildVersionData.cs= in a folder named =Editor= in Unity.
- Create a =BuildVersion.asset= file in Unity using a right click in the project view.
** Update the build number and commit hash
- Run the script =path/to/script/build-counter.py path/to/unity/asset/BuildVersion.asset major|minor|patch commit_hash=.
